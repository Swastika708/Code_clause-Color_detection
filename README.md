# Color-Detection
Internship task at CodeClause
Colour detection is the technique of identifying any color's name. Isn't that easy? Well, this is a very simple task for humans, but it is more complicated for computers. Light is converted into colour by the eyes and brains of living things. Our eyes have light receptors that send the signal to the brain. The colour is then recognised by our brain. We have associated specific lights with their colour designations since we were little. To find colour names, we'll employ an approach that is fairly similar. When you click on my programme, which I created, the name of the colour will be shown right away. As a result, we have a data file with the color's name and values for this. The shortest path from each colour will then be determined by calculating its distance. To break the cycle, press the "esc" key
By clicking on my program, which I built, will instantly give you the colour's name. We therefore have a data file for this that includes the name of the colour and its values. The shortest path from each colour will then be determined by calculating its distance. To break the cycle, press the "esc" key.
